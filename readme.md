## Portfolio

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twistezo/portfolio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twistezo/portfolio)

Portfolio website draft.

[Live](https://twistezo.github.io/portfolio) version.

### History

1. First version was written in Angular 4 (JS + TypeScript) with Bootstrap and Firebase.

   Check [angular](https://github.com/twistezo/portfolio/tree/angular) branch for code, detailed description and live preview.

ðŸ‘‰ 2. This is second, actual version. Rewritten from Angular to pure JavaScript.

3. Currently I'm rewriting this app to React with TypeScript.

   You can follow the progress on [react](https://github.com/twistezo/portfolio/tree/react) branch.

### Features

- uses `lit-html` for templating HTML pages in JS
- webpack with hot-reload, babel, minify, gzip and uglify HTML/CSS/JS for production build
- custom implementation of i18n (internationalization) which uses JSON file
- 6 pinned repositories in projects section fetched from GitHub GraphQL API

### Tools

JavaScript, Bootstrap, Webpack, lit-html, SCSS

### Usage

Build: `npm install`

Run in development mode: `npm run dev`

Build for production: `npm run prod`

Production output is in `docs/` for fastest deploy on github page

### FAQ

1. I18n texts are not visible when running production build locally.

```
Error message: `Failed to load file:///DRIVE:/.../portfolio/docs/i18n.json: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https.`

Caused by CORS mechanism. Occurs only locally. After deploying page or disabling CORS will be ok.
```
